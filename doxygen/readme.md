# Doxygen

Configuration and build target folder for documentation generated from the source.

The `CMakeList.txt` file located in this directory defines which folders are parsed by Dxygen during the documentation creation.

Doxygen comments should only be added to source code that is part of the external API integrated into and used by game servers to communicate with the ONE Platform. All other source should be documented via regular comments and readme files.
