# Fakes

The folders here contain apps or libraries that use the main SDK components.

- [fake/arcus/agent](arcus/agent/readme.md)
- [fake/arcus/game](arcus/game/readme.md)
- [fake/ping](ping/readme.md)

These serve multiple purposes:

1) illustrate how to use the libraries

2) provide black-box testing instruments for the automated tests
