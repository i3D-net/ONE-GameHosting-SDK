## File Structure

### Unit Tests

Do one of the following:

1. Put the file in the corresponding component folder within the one folder. For example "tests/one/arcus/arcus.cpp" if adding a test for something within "one/arcus/..".
2. Name the file after a header that is being tests, e.g. "ring.cpp" if testing "one/arcus/internal/ring.h".

### Integration Tests

1. If the testing a Fake Game with a Fake Agent, add it to tests/integration.cpp.
2. Integration tests should only reference public interfaces. No friend classes for testing purposes or touching of /internal folders.

### Utilities

Test utilities go in `tests/one/arcus/util.h` and eventually in `tests/one/ping/util.h`.
